This repo contains the main codes in the following paper:
Jicong Fan, Yuqian Zhang, and Madeleine Udell. Polynomial Matrix Completion for Missing Data Imputation and Transductive Learning. AAAI2020.

Two algorithms proposed in the paper:
PMC-S and PMC-W

test_PMC_synthetic: matrix completion on synthetic data generated from multiple manifolds (defined by polynomials)

test_PMC_mocapdata: matrix completion for recovering the CMU motion capture data

test_PMC_classification: transductive learning on incomplete data

Questions and comments can be sent to my email: jf577@cornell.edu
